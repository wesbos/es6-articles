# ES6 Articles

Blog posts and articles about ES6. These posts are derived from the video course available at [ES6.io](https://ES6.io).

Professional transcripts of the videos are being made available. From those we are creating easy to reference blog posts that will live on Wesbos.com. 

Anyone is welcome to convert transcripts to blog posts as a means of solidifying their ES6 knowledge. Reviews, spelling corrections and re-wording is also welcome.

## Naming Conventions

Prefix each article with the video number. Use a single leading zero for articles 1-9. The title should just use spaces as it shows in the video. Note the use of ` - ` in between the video number and the title.

_example:_

- 12 - Article Name.md 
- 02 - I sure love Pizza.md
