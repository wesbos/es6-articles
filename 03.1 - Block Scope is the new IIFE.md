## ES6 Block Scope is The new IIFE

You can probably see where `let` and `const` are going to be useful: **if you need to scope something to a block**, or **if you want to make a variable that cannot be changed** by accident or on purpose.

Let's take a look at a couple of more examples of when it might be useful.

The first one is replacing the **Immediately-Invoked Function Expression**, or **IIFE**. I'm not sure if you've ever heard of this before, but it was coined by [Ben Allman back in 2010]((http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/)).

An IIFE function runs itself immediately, and it creates a scope where nothing is going to leak into the parent scope. In our case, nothing is going to leak into the global scope of the window.

If I have a `var` variable: `var name = 'wes'`

You can call that in the console, and that's fine here. However, the window already has a `name` attribute, which is needed when you have a window opening up a another window.

That could something that some third-party JavaScript relies on in order for it to run, or maybe another script is using a variable called `name` and you accidentally overwrite that. It can get a little bit messy.

The way the IFFE fixes that is that the function runs immediately and you put your variables inside of that:

```js
(function() {
  var name = 'wes';
})();
```

These variables are now scoped to the IIFE function, and because `var` variables are function-scoped, they are not available in the global scope.

If you try to call `name` in the console now, it's not undefined, it's blank because, like I mentioned, it's just blank because that is a property that lives on the window natively in JavaScript.

If I needed to access our function's `name`, obviously, I'd have to do a `console.log` inside of the IIFE function, but the important thing is that it's no longer leaking into the global scope.

With `let` and `const` variables, we don't need a function for our variables to be scoped to that.

Why? Because `let` and `const` use **block scope**.

Let's start over with a `const` instead of a `var`

```js
const name = 'wes';
```

If we call this in the console, we'll see `'wes'`, but if we wrap it in curly brackets:

```js
{
const name = 'wes';
}

```

Our `const` is going to be scoped to that block. If you try to call `name` in the console, we'll get the window's `name`, which is blank. But if we add a `console.log` to our block:

```js
{
const name = 'wes';
console.log(name);
}

```
...we'll get `wes` in the console. You don't the IFFE stuff anymore. You're using `let` and `const` because they are going to be scoped to that block.
