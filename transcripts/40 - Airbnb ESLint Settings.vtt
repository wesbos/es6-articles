00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Man: Engineers at Airbnb, 

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.330
particularly this really nice 

3
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:06.900
JavaScript style guide, that 

4
00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:09.490
shows you how to write ES6 in a 

5
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.130
way that is consistent across 

6
00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:13.200
all of your projects. It does 

7
00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:14.380
things like it tells you to use 

8
00:00:14.455 --> 00:00:16.260
const and when to use let and 

9
00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:17.810
how to write your if statements 

10
00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.370
and where do you semicolons and 

11
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.090
etc., all that information, and 

12
00:00:22.165 --> 00:00:25.070
the ESLint file is sort of the 

13
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.210
enforcement of this actual style 

14
00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.350
guide. What a lot of people 

15
00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:30.990
do, is they adapt the Airbnb 

16
00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:32.550
style of coding and then they'll 

17
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:33.770
sort of just use their own 

18
00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.420
settings on top of it, and 

19
00:00:35.495 --> 00:00:36.040
that's exactly what we're going 

20
00:00:36.115 --> 00:00:37.450
to do here today. We're going to 

21
00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:38.990
implement the Airbnb style guide 

22
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.260
and then we're going to sort of 

23
00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:41.620
go through in and pick off 

24
00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:43.360
little things where we believe 

25
00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.060
that our style differs a little 

26
00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.070
bit. Go to github.com/airbnb/

27
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.400
JavaScript click on packages, 

28
00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.340
click on eslint-config-airbnb 

29
00:00:53.415 --> 00:00:54.970
and it's going to show us 

30
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.890
how it actually works. To 

31
00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.340
install someone else's style 

32
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.100
guide you can go to your 

33
00:01:02.175 --> 00:01:04.050
eslintrc and instead of 

34
00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:05.890
extending the ESLint recommended 

35
00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.100
we're going to extend the Airbnb, 

36
00:01:08.175 --> 00:01:09.280
and I'm going to show you what 

37
00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:10.590
happens if we just change that. 

38
00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.040
Go back to our console here and 

39
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:14.310
run ESLint against it, it's 

40
00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.200
going to give us an error here 

41
00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.040
cannot find module eslint-config-

42
00:01:18.115 --> 00:01:20.370
airbnb, why can't we do that? 

43
00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.080
Because we haven't yet actually 

44
00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:24.840
installed it. Now, you can 

45
00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.230
install this locally to your 

46
00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.530
project if you only need it on 

47
00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.390
one project. But since, I like 

48
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.720
to use it on every single 

49
00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:32.560
project that I'm working on I 

50
00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.270
like to install it globally. 

51
00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:35.500
Now, there's some install 

52
00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.210
instructions right here and what 

53
00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:38.350
I like to tell people do is just 

54
00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.200
go ahead and copy those install 

55
00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:41.430
instructions and paste them into 

56
00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.890
here. Then there's a few things 

57
00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.470
that's going to install ESLint 

58
00:01:45.545 --> 00:01:47.220
for us, we already have that, we 

59
00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.030
don't need it. We need the 

60
00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.190
accessibility JSX plugin. If you 

61
00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:52.690
aren't writing React you still 

62
00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:53.700
need to install that just 

63
00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:54.940
because all of these things here 

64
00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.450
were called pure dependencies 

65
00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.160
for ESLint and it needs to have 

66
00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.050
them all installed for us. We 

67
00:02:00.125 --> 00:02:00.840
get eslint-airbnb-config, we get 

68
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.080
the import plugin, we get the 

69
00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.400
React in the JSX accessibility 

70
00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:09.320
one. Next, we want to install 

71
00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.290
this globally so change --save-

72
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.390
dev to -g and go ahead and just 

73
00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.680
copy and paste that right into 

74
00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.760
your terminal here. Again, if 

75
00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:20.320
you are running the computer 

76
00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.610
where you've not yet fixed your 

77
00:02:21.685 --> 00:02:22.820
npm you might have to type 

78
00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.850
pseudo and then paste in npm-

79
00:02:24.925 --> 00:02:27.160
install. It's going to ask for 

80
00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:28.300
your password. You can type it 

81
00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:29.470
in, you won't see anything but 

82
00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.080
it will work and then just give 

83
00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.310
it a second while it goes ahead 

84
00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.910
and installs all of these 

85
00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.090
elements. If that has worked 

86
00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.440
properly we should now be able 

87
00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.850
to ESLint bad code and it's 

88
00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.040
going to tell us all kinds of 

89
00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.730
new errors that have been 

90
00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.100
happening with our actual code 

91
00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.300
right here. Let's go through a 

92
00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.700
couple. First of all there are a 

93
00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.340
whole bunch of errors that have 

94
00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.080
to do with spacing, a space is 

95
00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.650
required. Those are just such 

96
00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.850
minor little things that ESLint 

97
00:02:58.925 --> 00:03:00.220
will actually fix them 

98
00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.160
immediately for you. Right 

99
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.390
here I have this space where I 

100
00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.820
shouldn't have done it and I 

101
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.140
could go one by one and fix them 

102
00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.300
all. However, ESLint provides a --

103
00:03:10.375 --> 00:03:12.700
fix option. You can say ESLint 

104
00:03:12.775 --> 00:03:10.720
bad code--fix and what it does…

105
00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:20.720
See? It went from 12 problems 

106
00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.010
down to 2 problems, I go back to 

107
00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:24.150
this code and you see that it 

108
00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.320
just refreshed itself there. 

109
00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.100
It's going to fix almost all of 

110
00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.460
those little spacing issues for 

111
00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.340
us. Now we've got two other 

112
00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.890
problems here that are actually 

113
00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:35.790
running. First of all 

114
00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.420
unexpected var use let or const 

115
00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.280
instead, that's on line one, 

116
00:03:41.355 --> 00:03:43.950
let's go back up here. I'm 

117
00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.300
looking at this, I said var 

118
00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.040
whether = new Promise, so I'm 

119
00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:48.200
not going to be using var, 

120
00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.020
should I use let or should I use 

121
00:03:50.095 --> 00:03:50.820
const? Now the question here is 

122
00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.870
will I ever reassign whether, 

123
00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.580
does it need to update itself or 

124
00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:56.780
is it always going to hold this 

125
00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.920
whether promise? In the case 

126
00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.130
of us we're always going to be 

127
00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:01.700
holding the whether promise so 

128
00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:03.720
we use const, good, and we give 

129
00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.950
that a save and rerun it. One 

130
00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.650
more error, unaccepted block 

131
00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.300
statement surrounding arrow body 

132
00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:13.790
and this is the arrow-body-style. 

133
00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:15.240
It may not actually know like 

134
00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:16.720
what is the problem here, let's 

135
00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:19.360
go check it out. Line 25 it's 

136
00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.430
telling us unexpected block, 

137
00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.110
that's this thing right here 

138
00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.480
surrounding arrow-body-style, it 

139
00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:28.800
actually doesn't tell us what 

140
00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:29.980
the issue is. The issue with 

141
00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.430
here is that we have a block 

142
00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:33.910
statement and then all that 

143
00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.510
block is doing is returning. 

144
00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.350
What it actually should be 

145
00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.150
telling is that you should use 

146
00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.290
the implicit return if all that 

147
00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:42.710
you're going to be doing is 

148
00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.350
opening up a block and returning 

149
00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:46.350
one thing from it. Let's go 

150
00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.060
look at arrow-body-style -- read 

151
00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:52.170
the docs here. Arrow functions 

152
00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.080
have two formats. They may be 

153
00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:55.770
defined with a block or it's a 

154
00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.040
single expression, so it shows 

155
00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.240
us some examples of when you 

156
00:05:00.315 --> 00:05:03.040
wouldn't want to do it and when 

157
00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:04.380
you would want to use it. OK, 

158
00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.630
interesting. I like that error, 

159
00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.100
so I'm going to not turn it off 

160
00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:10.060
in here but I'm going to 

161
00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:12.060
actually go ahead and fix that 

162
00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.190
myself. We don't need a block 

163
00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.390
here, we don't need this return, 

164
00:05:17.465 --> 00:05:19.760
we don't need the opening block. 

165
00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:21.600
Now, this is going to 

166
00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:24.310
immediately return promises.all, 

167
00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.460
give that a save, now we'll run 

168
00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:28.090
back to our terminal and rerun 

169
00:05:28.165 --> 00:05:30.580
ESLint, and it should like 

170
00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:31.850
celebrate or something and tell 

171
00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:33.080
you that you did a good job but 

172
00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:35.250
it's simply just like "Yeah, of 

173
00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:35.350
course, you did a good job." 

174
00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.420
It's working for us, there we go. 

175
00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:39.640
So far we've been working with 

176
00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:42.140
the local.eslintrc file and that 

177
00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:44.490
means that we have an ESLint 

178
00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:46.070
file for every single project 

179
00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.520
that we work on. That can be 

180
00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:48.420
really handy when you have 

181
00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:50.030
different coding styles amongst 

182
00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:51.170
different projects or different 

183
00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:52.240
teams that you work with. 

184
00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:53.680
However, it's also helpful to 

185
00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:55.610
have a global eslintrc file, 

186
00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:57.530
which if you do not have an 

187
00:05:57.605 --> 00:05:59.740
ESLint file present anywhere 

188
00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:01.110
inside of your project, it's 

189
00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:02.570
going to use your global one as 

190
00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:04.180
sort of a default. I really 

191
00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:05.430
like to do that so I don't have 

192
00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.030
to create an ESLint file for 

193
00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:08.530
every single project or I have 

194
00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:10.080
one that I can copy/paste into 

195
00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:11.500
new projects that I'm going to 

196
00:06:11.575 --> 00:06:13.220
put up to GitHub and expect 

197
00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:14.770
others to follow that coding 

198
00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:17.080
style. I'm going to open up my 

199
00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:19.820
global one and it lives in your 

200
00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:20.940
home directory. What's your 

201
00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:22.410
home directory? Your home 

202
00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:25.200
directory is tilde, and that is 

203
00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:27.470
your folder by your username on 

204
00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.330
your computer, and in Windows is 

205
00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:30.950
going to be under C, users and 

206
00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:32.940
then your username. If you do 

207
00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:34.120
not have one you can do 

208
00:06:34.195 --> 00:06:38.920
touchtilde/.eslintrc, if you 

209
00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:40.270
already do have one you can just 

210
00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:43.240
open it up in your editor and…

211
00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:44.350
I'm going to show you exactly 

212
00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:46.210
what is inside of mine. I've 

213
00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:47.850
been extending Airbnb just like 

214
00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:49.860
we have in here, I've work in 

215
00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:51.520
the browser node and sometimes I 

216
00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:53.230
use jQuery so I've turned all of 

217
00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:55.590
those on then I have all of 

218
00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:57.300
these rules that I have been 

219
00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:59.480
working with. Now, I take all 

220
00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:01.220
the rules from Airbnb and then 

221
00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:02.450
these are the ones where I don't 

222
00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:04.600
necessarily agree a hundred 

223
00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:06.610
percent with Airbnb's 

224
00:07:06.685 --> 00:07:07.380
implementation so these are just 

225
00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:09.230
the once that I've sort of taken 

226
00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:11.480
over. Let's take a look at 

227
00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:13.280
one comma- dangle. I've turned 

228
00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:14.820
that off, if I write some code 

229
00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:16.730
right here and I'd say like 

230
00:07:16.805 --> 00:07:19.790
const west=open up an object and 

231
00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:23.050
I say age is 100, and cool, is 

232
00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:26.580
true, and I give that a save and 

233
00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:29.080
let's try the ESLint, our bad 

234
00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:30.640
code again. It's going to yell 

235
00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:31.760
us. A whole bunch of stuff, 

236
00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:34.400
first of all, no-unused-vars, 

237
00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:35.980
that's good because I've created 

238
00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:37.620
a variable and haven't yet used 

239
00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:39.410
that. That's actually one 

240
00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:41.850
that I have turned to a warning 

241
00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:44.510
in my regular ESLint right here, 

242
00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:49.160
no-unused-vars because I say, "

243
00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:50.770
Yeah, I should know when I don't 

244
00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:53.090
use a var but often I'm coding 

245
00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:54.530
and like I'm not done my 

246
00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:55.970
application yet and it's already 

247
00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:57.790
yelling at me for my errors." 

248
00:07:58.030 --> 00:07:59.370
What I would do is I turn that 

249
00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:01.100
to an actual warning. Let me 

250
00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:02.720
head to my local ESLint here, 

251
00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:06.570
and I'll say no-unused-vars, 

252
00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:08.140
that's going to be a 1, which is 

253
00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:12.430
a warning, and I'll rerun this 

254
00:08:12.505 --> 00:08:12.210
and now it's just warning me 

255
00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:13.530
instead of actually making an 

256
00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:15.380
error. Back to this comma- 

257
00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:17.080
dangle here, what is the actual 

258
00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:18.590
error? Sometimes people will say 

259
00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:20.010
that you should absolutely 

260
00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:21.330
always put a comma even if you 

261
00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:22.890
don't have another line. That's 

262
00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:24.100
because if you have checked 

263
00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:25.490
something into Git, let's say 

264
00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:27.830
that was my Git status right now 

265
00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:30.390
and then I add a new line like 

266
00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:33.010
dog is "Snickers," you know that 

267
00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:34.740
I just modified that line and 

268
00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:35.840
this line when I really just 

269
00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:37.090
wanted to add this one line. 

270
00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:38.970
People always put that dangling 

271
00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:40.670
comma on the end and I actually 

272
00:08:40.810 --> 00:08:42.490
generally agree with that but I 

273
00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:43.600
don't use it every single time 

274
00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:45.060
and I find it to be a bit of a 

275
00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:46.570
pain that it errors out on me, 

276
00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:49.390
so I've turned it off in my 

277
00:08:49.465 --> 00:08:50.910
ESLint with the comma-dangle 

278
00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:52.650
here. You might see this where 

279
00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:54.710
people pass in array instead of 

280
00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:57.760
just a 01 or 2, and this is 

281
00:08:57.770 --> 00:08:59.810
where you can pass options. 

282
00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:01.270
Some of these options here have 

283
00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:03.630
the ability to pass things as 

284
00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:06.410
needed props. In this case I 

285
00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:10.030
said no-unused-vars except when 

286
00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:13.650
the variable name is res, next 

287
00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:15.440
or error. And where is that 

288
00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:18.510
helpful? For me I write a lot of 

289
00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:20.910
node JS where I'll do something 

290
00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:25.650
like this, apdocget/accounts and 

291
00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:27.160
then I'll run a function here, 

292
00:09:27.235 --> 00:09:29.070
so it was like request and 

293
00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:33.780
response. I might be doing 

294
00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:35.960
something, and also it maybe 

295
00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:39.130
pass, next, I like to set up all 

296
00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:40.540
my routes like that and I might 

297
00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:43.170
not necessarily use res or next 

298
00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:44.350
but I like to have them there in 

299
00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:46.430
case I need to use them again. 

300
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.140
In this case it's going to yell 

301
00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:49.910
at me that I haven't yet used 

302
00:09:50.050 --> 00:09:52.320
res or next. What I've done is 

303
00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:55.200
I've set them to simply just 

304
00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:57.890
give me a warning when I haven't 

305
00:09:57.900 --> 00:09:59.460
use a variable. However, if I 

306
00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:01.060
use res, next or anything that 

307
00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:03.150
starts with error then don't 

308
00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:05.420
worry about that at all. Now, 

309
00:10:05.495 --> 00:10:05.810
I'm not going to sit here and go 

310
00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:07.290
through every single rule in all 

311
00:10:07.365 --> 00:10:08.690
of ESLint and sort of explaining 

312
00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:09.700
what you should and shouldn't 

313
00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:11.270
use. What I honestly think that 

314
00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:12.380
you should do is start with 

315
00:10:12.455 --> 00:10:14.340
Airbnb and just start writing 

316
00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:15.750
code and over the next like 

317
00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:17.580
couple of days what's going to 

318
00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:19.010
happen is you're going to come 

319
00:10:19.085 --> 00:10:19.290
out, you're going to trip over 

320
00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:21.200
errors, you're going to say, "

321
00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:21.860
Why is that error there?" Go 

322
00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:23.660
ahead and go to the ESLint docs, 

323
00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:25.220
research it, see if it's 

324
00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:26.500
actually a rule that makes sense 

325
00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:28.340
for you and your team. If it is, 

326
00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:30.020
make sure you keep it in your 

327
00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:31.500
rules. If it doesn't, take it 

328
00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:33.070
out of your rules or sent it to 

329
00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:35.090
warn instead of actual error. 

330
00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:36.790
A lot of times people ask me, "

331
00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:38.090
Hey, Wes can I just take your 

332
00:10:38.165 --> 00:10:41.070
ESLint?" I think that is OK, 

333
00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:43.370
however I maybe even prefer that 

334
00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:44.980
you just start with nothing and 

335
00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:47.070
just learn and build your own as 

336
00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:48.760
you start to go through this.
