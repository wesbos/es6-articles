00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
 

2
00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:04.080
Here's another example of when 

3
00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.330
tag templates could come in 

4
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:06.290
handy. It's when you're trying 

5
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.730
to add an abbreviation tag to a 

6
00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:10.380
sentence. I've got this 

7
00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:12.030
dictionary object right here 

8
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.550
where HTML, CSS and JS, and it 

9
00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:16.470
just shows what they actually 

10
00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.360
mean. Now if I go down here and 

11
00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:19.820
make a sentence about myself, 

12
00:00:19.895 --> 00:00:24.760
and say, "hello, my name is..." 

13
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.310
I want to pop in the first, and 

14
00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.350
I want to pop in the last, and, "

15
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.900
I love to code." Now I don't 

16
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.430
have variables for HTML, CSS and 

17
00:00:35.505 --> 00:00:38.230
JS. What you can do to make them 

18
00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.080
interpolated is just pass a 

19
00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:48.710
string, "HTML, CSS and JS." Now 

20
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:49.990
just because I pass in a string 

21
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.110
and not a variable, they are 

22
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.250
still going to show up when we 

23
00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.360
have that tag template. I am 

24
00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.240
going to just pop this into...

25
00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.780
I've got this bio right here. 

26
00:00:59.855 --> 00:01:00.520
I'm going to show you another 

27
00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:01.510
way. Instead of just popping it 

28
00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:02.710
right into the body, let's show 

29
00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.820
you how I might create an 

30
00:01:04.895 --> 00:01:07.220
element. I'm going to say const 

31
00:01:07.295 --> 00:01:09.740
bio = query selector. Going to 

32
00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.810
create a paragraph element, and 

33
00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.160
I'm going to set the inside of 

34
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.390
that paragraph to be the 

35
00:01:19.465 --> 00:01:24.390
sentence. Append it. Now we 

36
00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.990
go to our HTML here, say, "hello 

37
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.120
my name is Wes Boss. I love to 

38
00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.930
code HTML, CSS and JS." Now, how 

39
00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:32.470
do we get it so that when I 

40
00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.380
hover any of these variables, if 

41
00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:37.290
there is a dictionary item for 

42
00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:38.880
that variable or for that thing 

43
00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.790
that was passed in, that it will 

44
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.700
then show up? That's where we 

45
00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.090
can get a tag template. I'm 

46
00:01:45.165 --> 00:01:46.350
going to make a function here 

47
00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:49.440
called "add abbreviations." I 

48
00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:50.870
copy paste it there, so I do not 

49
00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.610
know how to spell abbreviation. 

50
00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.080
In this, so it's going to be a 

51
00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.560
little bit different than the 

52
00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.050
last one that we did. I want to 

53
00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.250
make a new array of, not just of 

54
00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.530
values, because the values are 

55
00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.220
going to give me "Wes," "Boss," "

56
00:02:05.295 --> 00:02:07.220
HTML," "CSS," and "JS." I 

57
00:02:07.295 --> 00:02:10.350
want an array of values that, if 

58
00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.560
there's an abbreviation, I want 

59
00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.740
them wrapped in an APBR tag. 

60
00:02:13.815 --> 00:02:16.130
What I'm going to say is const 

61
00:02:16.205 --> 00:02:21.230
abbreviated. I'm going to take 

62
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.080
the regular values and map over 

63
00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.950
them, and return a new array of 

64
00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:26.820
the values. We'll say for each 

65
00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.630
value...now we're going to check 

66
00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.290
if there is a value in the 

67
00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.590
dictionary. We'll say if the 

68
00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.630
dictionary has an item for that 

69
00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.350
specific value, so if there's a 

70
00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.090
value of "Wes," is there's going 

71
00:02:41.165 --> 00:02:42.210
to be a value of "Wes?" No, 

72
00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:43.400
there's not. It's just going to 

73
00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.220
skip over that. Is there a value 

74
00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.470
of "HTML?" If the dictionary has 

75
00:02:47.545 --> 00:02:49.540
an "HTML" key, oh yes there is, 

76
00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.570
there is one. We're just using a 

77
00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:54.650
variable there. If that is 

78
00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.180
true then, we are going to 

79
00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.500
return the abbreviation tag, 

80
00:02:58.575 --> 00:03:01.800
which is "APBR," and the title 

81
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.160
of that abbreviation tag is 

82
00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:04.850
going to be the dictionary item 

83
00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.850
with that key of "HTML, CSS or 

84
00:03:06.925 --> 00:03:08.420
JS." Then inside of the 

85
00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.360
abbreviation tag, we are going 

86
00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.050
to return the value there. What 

87
00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.030
that's going to give us if we 

88
00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.880
console.log the abbreviated 

89
00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.750
values here, and we take that 

90
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.230
tag template, pop it on to here. 

91
00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.470
You'll see we get undefined, 

92
00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:29.550
undefined. Why do we get 

93
00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:30.900
undefined, undefined? That's Wes 

94
00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:32.240
and Boss, what I forgot to do 

95
00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.910
here. Otherwise, we just want to 

96
00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.700
return the value. If it's not in 

97
00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:37.810
the dictionary, it's just a 

98
00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.080
regular variable. We're going to 

99
00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.420
skip over that, but we still 

100
00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:41.380
need to return it into the 

101
00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.890
actual variable there. Here we 

102
00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.670
go. "Wes Boss." Now each of 

103
00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.190
our values array is now 

104
00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.740
abbreviation tags that have been 

105
00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.340
created for us, cool. Now we're 

106
00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:52.360
not working with the values or 

107
00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:53.080
any more. We're going to be 

108
00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:54.000
working with this new 

109
00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.210
abbreviated tag. Then we can 

110
00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:57.820
take our strings array and start 

111
00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:59.360
to piece it together. Last time 

112
00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.230
I did this one, where I said let 

113
00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.760
string = empty string and that 

114
00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:05.080
might be comfortable for you. 

115
00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.200
If you would rather use a reduce 

116
00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:08.580
function, I'm going to show you 

117
00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:10.830
how to do that. From this 

118
00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.170
abbreviation function, we are 

119
00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.460
going to return strings.reduce(). 

120
00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:17.400
The way that reduce works is 

121
00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.650
that it will loop over each one, 

122
00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.940
and build the string as we go. 

123
00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.350
It has that all inside of the 

124
00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.590
function. We don't have to say 

125
00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.130
this like let str = outside of 

126
00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:28.380
the function. The whole thing 

127
00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:29.910
is nice and tidy inside of a 

128
00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.670
single reduce function. Reduce 

129
00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:32.580
takes two things. It takes the 

130
00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:33.860
function, and it takes what you 

131
00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.630
start with. We're going to start 

132
00:04:35.705 --> 00:04:37.010
with an empty string, and then 

133
00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.240
the actual function that we want 

134
00:04:38.315 --> 00:04:40.080
to run is going to be an 

135
00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.850
anonymous function, which gives 

136
00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.140
us sentence, which is going to 

137
00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.640
be whatever the previous one was. 

138
00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:48.110
The first one it's going to be a 

139
00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.260
blank string. It's going to give 

140
00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:52.950
us the actual string and the 

141
00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.640
index for that one. I'm going to 

142
00:04:55.715 --> 00:04:56.270
use an error function with a 

143
00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.140
block here. From that we return. 

144
00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:01.810
We're just going to build this 

145
00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:03.700
entire thing together. We want 

146
00:05:03.775 --> 00:05:05.170
to take the existing sentence. 

147
00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:08.090
This is going to be whatever it 

148
00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:09.820
was from the last iteration. 

149
00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.150
We are going to tack on the 

150
00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.800
string. Notice how I'm not doing 

151
00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:17.670
a space here, because the spaces 

152
00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.340
that are in the string will 

153
00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:20.890
actually come along in the 

154
00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:22.250
string itself. We don't need a 

155
00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.830
space there. Then we want to 

156
00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.950
tack on the abbreviated, because 

157
00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:31.890
we have this array here. Square 

158
00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.450
bracket "I" or nothing, just 

159
00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:35.510
that little trick that we did 

160
00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.700
earlier there. What that does 

161
00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:39.730
is -- I think now we should take 

162
00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:43.590
a look. "String is not defined." 

163
00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.720
Uh, oh, where is that our string, "

164
00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.300
S." strings that reduce? There 

165
00:05:48.375 --> 00:05:49.960
we go. "Hello my name is Wes 

166
00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:51.510
Boss. I love to code HTML," 

167
00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:54.950
hover over, "CSS and JS." I 

168
00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.380
inspect that. Now our string 

169
00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:59.260
here has been created with 

170
00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:02.390
abbreviation tag. That's a 

171
00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:04.080
great example of when you might 

172
00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:06.030
want to use it. You just have to 

173
00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.720
tack on this add abbreviation 

174
00:06:07.795 --> 00:06:08.960
and it's going to externally go 

175
00:06:09.035 --> 00:06:10.650
and look up your dictionary, as 

176
00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:13.160
well as, do all of this messy 

177
00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.010
function right here. You just 

178
00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:16.550
have to tack this one on in 

179
00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:17.840
front of any time that you use 

180
00:06:17.915 --> 00:06:18.240
it.
