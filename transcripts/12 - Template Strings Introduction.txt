[00:02] Instructor: In JavaScript, when you want to put a variable inside of a string, it's actually a pain in the ass because you have to stop your string, concatenate on the variable, and then open your string again and keep going. 

[00:12] Every other language has the ability to just drop your variables right inside of a string and just interpolate it like that, but not JavaScript.

[00:20] What ends up happening is you forget one of your closing, and you get an error and it tells you it's on line 11. You're like "Of course it's on line 11, but I don't know where it is."

[00:30] We can fix all of that with what's called template strings, or template literals. In JavaScript we have double quotes and single quotes to make a string. Now we have a third way to make a string, and that is with back-ticks.

[00:44] We're going to take this code right here, and first of all I'm going to make all those const, as they do not change, so there's no need to have those as a var or a let. 

[00:53] Now we have a name variable, we're setting that to "Snickers." We have an age variable that's set to two, and we have the sentence variable that I'm making.

[01:01] How do we change this now? Let's look at it. I'm going to actually use back-ticks here, close the back-tick there, and then anywhere I needed to open that, we simply use dollar sign, curly bracket -- you see the syntax highlighting change -- and close your curly bracket. That is going to pop in, or interpolate, the actual variable that we previously had set there.

[01:27] We don't need any of this. We want age, dollar sign parentheses. You can also do JavaScript straight away inside of these curly brackets here. You can pop in a variable, you can run a function, you can also run straight JavaScript. 

[01:42] I'm calculating the age in dog years right inside of that, get rid of that and we're good to go. Console log sentence, and you will now see it's just a regular sentence.

[01:54] Uh oh, what happened here? Const. I was duplicating it so I could show you the old version and the new version. Obviously you can't declare the same variable twice, so I need to get rid of that. Now it says my dog Snickers is 14 years old in dog years.

[02:09] That is template strings at the very basic. However there's quite a bit more that we can do with it. It can be very handy other than just being able to stick variables inside of it.
