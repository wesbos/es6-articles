00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:02.910
 Instructor: We've 

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:04.890
learned about lat and const and 

3
00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:05.240
what they do, and how they're 

4
00:00:05.315 --> 00:00:06.440
scoped, and when they can be 

5
00:00:06.515 --> 00:00:07.710
reassigned and when they cannot, 

6
00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:09.100
but there's a question as to 

7
00:00:09.175 --> 00:00:10.530
what I should actually use 

8
00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.860
myself. That's a bit of a 

9
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.960
hot topic in the community right 

10
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:17.320
now, because some people prefer 

11
00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.050
to still use var. Some people 

12
00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:20.290
are saying, "Var is dead, 

13
00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.000
entirely." Some people say, "Use 

14
00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:23.640
lat." Some people always use 

15
00:00:23.715 --> 00:00:24.130
const. I'm just going to go 

16
00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.920
over two of the leading opinions 

17
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.870
here. These are both done by 

18
00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:31.330
some very, very smart people in 

19
00:00:31.405 --> 00:00:32.520
the JavaScript scene, so I'll 

20
00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:34.450
let you pick your own. This 

21
00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.380
one, by Mathias Bynens, is how I 

22
00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.100
do it. He talked more about this 

23
00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:42.730
like, "Const is not about 

24
00:00:42.805 --> 00:00:43.080
immutability where you can 

25
00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:44.740
change the properties." We went 

26
00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.800
over that, but if you scroll 

27
00:00:46.875 --> 00:00:46.760
down to the bottom right here, 

28
00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.490
this is how he uses it, and this 

29
00:00:50.565 --> 00:00:50.580
is how I use it. "Use const 

30
00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:51.850
by default," so whenever you 

31
00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.460
make a variable, assume it's 

32
00:00:53.535 --> 00:00:55.350
const. "Use let only if 

33
00:00:55.425 --> 00:00:56.510
rebinding is needed." Only if 

34
00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.250
you need to update the value of 

35
00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.840
your variable, you should use 

36
00:00:59.915 --> 00:01:02.750
let. You can use const to keep 

37
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.490
it the same value. Then, var 

38
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:05.940
should not be ever used in ES6. 

39
00:01:06.015 --> 00:01:07.150
That's sort of what I'm 

40
00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.070
following. Another popular 

41
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.420
opinion here, by Kyle Simpson, 

42
00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:12.820
who writes a whole bunch of 

43
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:14.930
awesome JavaScript books is, "

44
00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.090
Use var for top level variables 

45
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.670
that are shared across many," so 

46
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.430
share larger scopes so you can 

47
00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.530
put them inside of your function. "

48
00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.110
Use let for localized variables 

49
00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.720
in smaller scopes." "Refactor 

50
00:01:26.795 --> 00:01:29.790
let to const only after some 

51
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.770
code has to be written, and 

52
00:01:31.845 --> 00:01:31.980
you're reasonably sure that the 

53
00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.760
case there shouldn't be a 

54
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:33.930
variable reassign," because that 

55
00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.680
is bit of a pain with const. If 

56
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.490
you realize later that, "Oh, I 

57
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.830
do need to update this value," 

58
00:01:38.905 --> 00:01:40.370
you have to go back and make it 

59
00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.750
a let instead of a const. 

60
00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.490
Both of those are very valid 

61
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.380
opinions. I'll let you make your 

62
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.640
own choices on that. Through the 

63
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:47.890
series, I'm going to be 

64
00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.990
following this advice on this 

65
00:01:51.065 --> 00:01:51.390
one.
