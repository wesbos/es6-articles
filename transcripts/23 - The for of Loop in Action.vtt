00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:03.370
Let's take a deeper look into 

2
00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:05.210
when an iterable actually is. 

3
00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:07.320
Here I've got my array, and I'm 

4
00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:08.620
looping over it, and I'm console 

5
00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:09.850
logging the cut. No big deal. 

6
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.460
But what if I want to get the 

7
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.290
index of the actual cut as well 

8
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.150
to say Chuck is first, Brisket 

9
00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.110
is second, etc., etc.? There's 

10
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.740
no real good way to do that 

11
00:00:19.815 --> 00:00:21.960
right here unless I were to say 

12
00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:23.610
cuts to indexOf and find it 

13
00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:26.370
every single time. What we 

14
00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.100
don't know about yet is that 

15
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:29.740
there are these things called 

16
00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:31.180
generators - and we're going to 

17
00:00:31.255 --> 00:00:32.430
go into a whole bunch of that in 

18
00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.670
the video - but if you go into 

19
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:35.780
your console here and do this 

20
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.280
with me, say cuts.entries, what 

21
00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.180
that is going to give us is 

22
00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.420
actually an array iterator. If 

23
00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:44.770
you open it up you'd expect to 

24
00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.590
see all the data, but there's 

25
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.000
nothing in there. All you know 

26
00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.800
that there's a Next function 

27
00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:53.270
that we can call on it. So if 

28
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.840
we actually store that array 

29
00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.630
cuts.entries in a variable, so 

30
00:00:57.705 --> 00:01:01.480
const, say meat=cuts.entries. 

31
00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:03.270
Now what do we have? Meat. Is 

32
00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.150
that all of the meat? No, it's 

33
00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.040
the iterator and we can iterate 

34
00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.810
through each of those ones 

35
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.550
manually. This loop was doing it 

36
00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.910
for us, but if we ever wanted to 

37
00:01:13.985 --> 00:01:14.310
do it manually - and we'll look 

38
00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.430
at more examples when we hit 

39
00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.080
generators - you call it meat.

40
00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.410
next, and meat.next, and then 

41
00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.360
meat.next. Let's see what we 

42
00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:24.210
got there, a couple of more 

43
00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.480
times, there we go. So what do 

44
00:01:27.555 --> 00:01:28.060
we get here? Well, the first 

45
00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.300
time we called it we got done: 

46
00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.090
false, and that means that the 

47
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.650
loop hasn't finished -- more in 

48
00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.220
the generator video. Then the 

49
00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:36.890
value is in array where the 

50
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.170
first thing is going to be the 

51
00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:39.830
index, and the second thing is 

52
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.430
going to be the actual value. 

53
00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.820
The second one, one is brisket, 

54
00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:46.860
third one, fourth one, you 

55
00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:48.610
probably get the point. It tells 

56
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.880
us what the index does is and 

57
00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.380
what the short rib is. Why would 

58
00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:54.900
this be useful to us in this 

59
00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:56.010
video where we're learning about 

60
00:01:56.085 --> 00:01:58.370
four of? Because what you can do 

61
00:01:58.445 --> 00:02:00.870
is if we iterate over not just 

62
00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.720
the plain array but we iterate 

63
00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.310
over the array iterator which is .

64
00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.620
entries, watch what we'll get 

65
00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.540
now. OK, so now we get cut is 

66
00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.840
not chuck brisket, cut is an 

67
00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.950
array every single time that we 

68
00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.520
go through it. Now you might be 

69
00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.580
saying, "That's annoying because 

70
00:02:20.655 --> 00:02:23.020
now I have to say cut zero and 

71
00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.780
cut one to get the index and the 

72
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.360
value." But hopefully you're 

73
00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.810
screaming at me right now and 

74
00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.380
you're going to say, "Well, Wes 

75
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:34.860
I can use destructuring there, 

76
00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.590
right?" Because what we can do 

77
00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.000
is we can say for const, index, 

78
00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.520
and cut, because each of this is 

79
00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.490
going to return an array, we can 

80
00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:48.050
just immediately destructure 

81
00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.710
that into their own variables, 

82
00:02:50.785 --> 00:02:52.930
so const I and cut. Now, if we 

83
00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.990
just console.log I. Let's put 

84
00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:56.880
this in a tablet string. Cut is 

85
00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:02.210
the I item. Now we should have a 

86
00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.460
variable.cut and a variable 

87
00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.970
called I, there we go, chuck is 

88
00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.240
the zero item, brisket is the 

89
00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:08.910
first item, second, and third 

90
00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:09.950
etc., etc.. If you wanted to 

91
00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:10.920
offset that you would just add 

92
00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.790
one to it in first, second and 

93
00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.770
third and fourth. Good. What 

94
00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:17.140
are we doing here? We're using 

95
00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.270
cuts.entries to bring us an 

96
00:03:19.345 --> 00:03:21.920
iterator. For...of, this is kind 

97
00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.170
of the nice thing about for...of, 

98
00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:24.510
is it can pretty much handle 

99
00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:25.990
anything that you throw at it. 

100
00:03:26.065 --> 00:03:28.010
You don't have to think, "What 

101
00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.520
kind of data is this? Which of 

102
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.140
mine like four or different 

103
00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:32.860
loops that I have available to 

104
00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.790
me should I use?" In almost all 

105
00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.530
cases, except for objects, you 

106
00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.090
can just use your for...of, and 

107
00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.940
just throw anything at it, and 

108
00:03:40.015 --> 00:03:41.860
the for...of loop is going to 

109
00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:43.820
just figure out how to handle 

110
00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:45.520
that data for you. So here I've 

111
00:03:45.595 --> 00:03:47.400
destructured the data as we 

112
00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.520
actually go on in, and we're off 

113
00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:51.520
and running with that. Let's 

114
00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:52.540
look at another example where 

115
00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:54.320
for...of is useful. That is when 

116
00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:55.330
you're trying to iterate over 

117
00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.060
the arguments objects. I'm just 

118
00:03:57.135 --> 00:03:58.250
going to take this out for a 

119
00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.010
second. Let's say we have a 

120
00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.180
function called add up numbers. 

121
00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:04.490
And that function is going to be 

122
00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.880
called like this, add up numbers. 

123
00:04:06.955 --> 00:04:08.090
You have no idea how many 

124
00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.360
numbers are going to get passed. 

125
00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:10.160
Maybe some of this is going to 

126
00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.960
pass a whole bunch of them. When 

127
00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:14.970
you're declaring the function, 

128
00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.530
you can't really like put a 

129
00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:18.330
whole bunch of placeholders, 

130
00:04:18.405 --> 00:04:21.180
like num1, num2, num3, just in 

131
00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:22.630
case they past that many, 

132
00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.000
because you have absolutely no 

133
00:04:24.075 --> 00:04:25.230
idea how many arguments are 

134
00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.980
going to pass. So instead of 

135
00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:28.170
putting anything in there, what 

136
00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:29.320
we can do inside of this 

137
00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:30.480
function is to just console.log 

138
00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:31.940
this variable called arguments. 

139
00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:33.870
Now that is a special word and 

140
00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.350
it's going to be in array-ish 

141
00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.440
type where it will give us all 

142
00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:40.920
of the actual arguments. So 

143
00:04:40.995 --> 00:04:42.250
let's take a look here. Cool. 

144
00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.430
That arguments is now what looks 

145
00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.080
to be an array, it's not exactly 

146
00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:48.920
an array of everything that got 

147
00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.520
passed in. Why I'm so bent up on 

148
00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:53.120
saying it's array-ish is because 

149
00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:54.680
if you open it up, you'll see a 

150
00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:55.910
couple of things right here. 

151
00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.170
First of all the prototype is 

152
00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.240
not an array. What happens, let 

153
00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:00.470
me just console.log a regular 

154
00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:03.170
array just to show you. One, two, 

155
00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.860
three. This is a regular array. 

156
00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.530
Open that sucker up. The 

157
00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:10.240
prototype of that thing was the 

158
00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:11.650
array, and if you open that up 

159
00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:14.000
you'll see here's all the crazy 

160
00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:15.960
array methods that we're used to 

161
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.310
like every entries, and cat, and 

162
00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:19.420
map, and push, and pop, and 

163
00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:20.440
reduce, and everything we could 

164
00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:21.720
possibly want, right? Because 

165
00:05:21.795 --> 00:05:23.420
that has built up a proper array. 

166
00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:27.620
Now, arguments is simply just a 

167
00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.560
list with only one thing on it: 

168
00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.520
length. However, you can iterate 

169
00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:35.590
over it with the for...of loop 

170
00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.300
because it has a symbol iterator. 

171
00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:40.300
Normally, in a case like this, I 

172
00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:41.790
would probably just convert 

173
00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.440
arguments to a real array and 

174
00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:45.690
use a reduce on it and add them 

175
00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.410
all up. But for whatever reason, 

176
00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:48.540
if you're ever in the use-case 

177
00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:49.900
where you cannot convert your 

178
00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:51.560
arguments to an object maybe for 

179
00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:53.300
some performance reasons, or 

180
00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:55.850
whatever you have, then you can 

181
00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:57.960
go ahead and loop over arguments 

182
00:05:57.970 --> 00:05:59.690
without first converting to an 

183
00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:00.570
array. There's no need to 

184
00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:01.660
convert it to an array if you 

185
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:02.770
just need to loop over them. 

186
00:06:02.845 --> 00:06:05.570
What I'm going to do is I'm 

187
00:06:05.645 --> 00:06:07.700
going to say let total=zero, 

188
00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:09.580
start with zero and then I'm 

189
00:06:09.655 --> 00:06:10.650
going to loop over each of them. 

190
00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:14.410
So I'm going to say for num in 

191
00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:19.610
arguments total + = num then we 

192
00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:22.380
should be able to return the 

193
00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:24.620
total here. That should add them 

194
00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:27.300
all up, let's see. I'm going to 

195
00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:28.080
console.log total as well just 

196
00:06:28.155 --> 00:06:31.240
so we can see it. I've got a 

197
00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:34.970
bit of an error here. What is my 

198
00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:36.290
mistake here, can you spot it? 

199
00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:38.570
Why is it saying 00123456? 

200
00:06:38.645 --> 00:06:40.780
Because I said for...in, it's 

201
00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:44.400
for...of, not for...in. For...in 

202
00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:46.630
would give us the index. For...

203
00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:47.680
of will give us the actual 

204
00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:50.030
argument. Refresh. There we go, 

205
00:06:50.105 --> 00:06:51.980
267, because I created a 

206
00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:53.380
variable and it looped through 

207
00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:54.660
it and it updated every single 

208
00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:56.510
one of them. Now, if I ever want 

209
00:06:56.585 --> 00:06:58.070
to call add up numbers, what's 

210
00:06:58.145 --> 00:07:00.520
10 + 10? 20. What if I want to 

211
00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.170
do a whole bunch, more of them? 

212
00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:04.010
Not a problem, it's going to 

213
00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:07.550
give me 256, appropriate. That 

214
00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:09.030
is one example of what you could 

215
00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:10.440
loop over it. You do not need to 

216
00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:12.400
convert to a true array, you can 

217
00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:14.500
just use the for...of to iterate 

218
00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:15.710
over it. What else can we use to 

219
00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.710
the for...of to iterate over? 

220
00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:18.990
That's for a string, so maybe 

221
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.330
you have a name like Wes Bos. 

222
00:07:21.405 --> 00:07:23.730
I'm going to say for const 

223
00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:27.050
character of name, console.log, 

224
00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:28.970
the character, and that will 

225
00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:31.990
give us the s-base B-O-S. Notice 

226
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.860
how I put a const there? I think 

227
00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:35.120
I forgot. Yeah. You make sure 

228
00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:37.600
you put a const, a let, or a var 

229
00:07:37.675 --> 00:07:39.020
in front of this, otherwise 

230
00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:40.360
you're going to be overwriting 

231
00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:42.240
the actual variable every single 

232
00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:43.750
time instead of creating a let 

233
00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:45.370
or a const that is scoped to 

234
00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:47.510
that actual block. Finally, you 

235
00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:49.660
can also loop over DAM 

236
00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:50.810
collections without having to 

237
00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:52.740
convert to a true array. Now, 

238
00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:54.890
DOM collections, or nodeless or 

239
00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:57.690
HTML collections, whatever 

240
00:07:57.700 --> 00:07:58.850
you're going to call them, they 

241
00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:00.760
are being changed so that you 

242
00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:02.700
will have all of your .for each, 

243
00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:04.350
and .map, and all of those array 

244
00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:05.420
methods that you're used to. 

245
00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:07.150
However, in most browsers they 

246
00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:09.330
are not a true array, so we 

247
00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:11.600
could use the for...of, no 

248
00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:13.550
problem there. Maybe we'll give 

249
00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:15.080
ourselves a couple of paragraph 

250
00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:16.900
tags in the body up here. Let's 

251
00:08:16.975 --> 00:08:20.070
just say a paragraph that says 

252
00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:24.870
something like IIOP$, let's give 

253
00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:26.680
ourselves 10 of them. Cool so 

254
00:08:26.755 --> 00:08:27.190
I've got a whole bunch of 

255
00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:29.320
paragraphs on the page here, 

256
00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:31.500
let's see them all right here. 

257
00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:35.840
Then I want to select them, say 

258
00:08:35.915 --> 00:08:37.040
const piece = document.

259
00:08:37.115 --> 00:08:42.980
querySelector all paragraph. 

260
00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:45.210
Then I'm just going to console.

261
00:08:45.285 --> 00:08:46.580
log the paragraphs. So this, 

262
00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:48.800
open it up. See, it's not a true 

263
00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:50.560
array it is a nodeless, but if 

264
00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:52.000
you open that up you will see 

265
00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:54.360
that we have dot for each as 

266
00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:55.810
well as a couple other of the 

267
00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:57.730
array methods that we're used to. 

268
00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:00.230
If you want to loop over it with 

269
00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:01.620
a for...of loop, or const 

270
00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:07.700
paragraph of piece, then 

271
00:09:07.775 --> 00:09:09.570
we can console.log the paragraph, 

272
00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:10.740
you see that we get each 

273
00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:12.230
individual one here, and that's 

274
00:09:12.305 --> 00:09:13.130
useful if you want to do 

275
00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:15.360
something like paragraph at 

276
00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:18.810
event listener on click, 

277
00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:24.190
function, console.log, .text 

278
00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.140
content. Anytime someone clicks 

279
00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:30.090
on a paragraph go ahead and 

280
00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:31.520
console.log whatever is inside 

281
00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:34.780
of it. Do three if you want, do 

282
00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:36.500
two if you want. Good. Didn't 

283
00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:37.900
need to convert it to an array. 

284
00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:40.130
Again, you totally can. I'm not 

285
00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:41.590
sure of a huge performance 

286
00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:42.930
difference between the two. You 

287
00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:44.300
can do your own testing on that. 

288
00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:45.660
But it's helpful to know that 

289
00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:47.460
you can use this for...of with 

290
00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:49.020
things that aren't arrays, as 

291
00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:50.510
long as they're an iterable. And 

292
00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:52.020
what is an iterable, a DOM 

293
00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:53.920
collection, argument, a string, 

294
00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:56.460
an array, a map, or a set.
