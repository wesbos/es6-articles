[00:02] Instructor: Remember we talked about the for-of loop, and how it pretty much works with absolutely everything except for objects? Well, it actually works on looping through generators as well.

[00:10] Let's take a quick look at an example right here, where I'll create a generator called lyrics. This lyrics function is just going to yield a line of, "My Achy Breaky Heart," every single time that we go through to it. I'm going to just type "yield" in front of each one. 

[00:31] To go through this, we could call create a new generator. Let's do that.

[00:43] We see we have achy.next.next.next.next.next. What if we don't want to manually call that, and we don't want to write some sort of recursive function? Well, you can use the for-of loop...and just console.log the line. Notice how we're not going to call next anywhere in here. It just console.logs it all for us.

[01:08] That's really useful if you've got a generator that has either some hard-coded stuff that you need to loop through, or even better yet, you have a dynamic function that would generate some code for you, or some lines, or some numbers, or some objects.

[01:27] Whatever type of content it is, you can just use the for-of loop to loop right through it, just like it does on arrays, and sets, and maps, and everything else we talked about with the for-of loop.
