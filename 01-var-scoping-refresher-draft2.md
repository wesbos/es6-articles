There are a couple new ways to declare variables in ES6 that help us out with scoping. We can declare variables with `var`, which we've always used, but now we can use `let` and `const`
to declare variables too.

These two have some attributes about them which are going to be helpful for us in creating variables but let's do a quick review to show you  how `var`, `let`, and `const` are different.

Firstly, `var` variables can be **redefined** or **updated**. Let's use console.log to show the width which we can update the width to be 200, and then we'll console log the width again.

```
 var width = 100;
 console.log(width);
 width = 200;
 console.log(width);
```

If you run this in your browser, you'll see we get 100, 200, which isn't a big deal. We're able to update them. You can also put a `var` in front of line 3 if you like, but if you do, it won't do anything. It will work as you'd expect, but it won't yell at you for creating the same variable name twice in the same scope because `var` variables can be **updated** or **redefined**.

We also need to remember how `var` variables are scoped. **Scoping** essentially means, "Where are these variables available to me?" In the case of `var` variables, they're **function scope**, which means that they are only available inside the function that they are created in. However, if they are not declared in a function, then they are **globally scoped**, and they're available in the whole window.

If I created a function  and put my var width inside of it, and console logged the width, and then I were to run it? Is that going to work?

```
function setWidth() {
var width = 100;
console.log(width);
}
setWidth();
```


Of course, it's going to work because this width is available inside of this function.

But if I also tried to console log the width after I've set the width like this?

```
function setWidth() {
var width = 100;
console.log(width);
}
setWidth();
console.log(width);
```



It won't work. Why won't it work? Because **`width` is only scoped to that function**. It is a local variable to our setWidth function. It is not available outside the confines. Think of the curly brackets as gates, or function jail, and our `var` variables are in there.

That's important for us to know. If you do want to globally scope width, we need to declare it outside the function like so, and update it inside the function:

```
var width;
function setWidth() {
width = 100;
console.log(width);
}
setWidth();
console.log(width);
```

Generally, it's probably not what you want to do. You want to keep your variables inside of your function. If you need something outside of a function, you want to return it and store that in a variable. That's something that we need to know about function scoping. But I'm going to show you a use case where function scoping sort of comes back and bites us.

Let's say we have an age variable and we have an if statement. We want to create a number of dog years. If they are greater than 12, let's calculate their ages in dog years and show "You are (however many) dog years old" in the console if they're older than 12.

```
var age = 100;
if(age > 12) {
var dogYears = age * 7;
console.log(`You are ${dogYears} dog years old!`);
}

```

Just as an aside, you can see I'm using back ticks in this example, but I'm going to tell you all about this in the "Template Strings" section.

The one thing that is a little bit strange here is that `var dogYears` is just a temporary variable, and I just needed this real quick in order to calculate something and then stick it into a `console.log` or stick it into a string or whatever. If you go to your browser console and call `dogYears`, you'll see that it's leaked outside of the if statement and it is now a global variable, which isn't really what we want.

Even though this was a temporary variable that I only needed inside of one if statement, because `var` variables are **function scoped** and remember, there's no function here, it's going to be **globally scoped**. It's scoped to the entire window, which is a little bit of a pain here. That is one of the benefits to using `let` and `const`. Instead of being scoped to the function, it is **block scoped**, which is something new.

What is a block? Here is a great example:

```
...
if(age > 12) {
 var dogYears = age * 7;
console.log(`You are ${dogYears} dog years old!`);
}

...
```


 Any time that you see **curly brackets**, that's a block. Functions are also blocks, `let` and `const` are still going to be scoped to a function, but if inside of that function or if inside of some other element that you have, **it will be scoped to the closest set of curly brackets**.

If I now take this dog years here and change it to `let`...

```
var age = 100;
if(age > 12) {
let dogYears = age * 7;
console.log(`You are ${dogYears} dog years old!`);
}

```
...and I refresh, everything works as we would want. However, if you call `dogYears` in the browser console, it says, "Dog years is not defined." Why? Because I declared it as a **`let` variable**. It is only declared inside of a block scope, now, not a global scope like `var`, a block scope, and that temporary variable has not leaked out of the block. You can also use `const` and get the same results, but you might not want to do that, which we'll talk about next time.
