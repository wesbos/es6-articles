## Quick Tip: Use `let` with `for` loops in JavaScript

Another problem `let` and `const` will fix is with our `for` loop.

This is something in which you probably have all run into with your regular `for` loop, like one that will count from zero to nine:

```js
for(var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
```

Two problems arise here:

**First** of all, if I type `i` into the console, it returns `10`. We have this global variable that has leaked into the window, or into a parent scope, which is not something we necessarily want. It's just a placeholder value that we need inside of this loop.

**Second** of all, maybe you have something that's going to run after some bit of time, like an AJAX request, or in this case, a `setTimeout()` function that runs after one second:

```js
for(var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log(i);
  setTimeout(function() {
    console.log('The number is ' + i);
  },1000);
}
```

If we run this, all of the `i`s being logged from within the `setTimeout()` function are 10, while the `i`s being logged before the `setTimeout()` function will increment normally. The reason that we have that is because, `console.log(i)` will run immediately at `console.log` itself and reference whatever `i` is.

However, when the `setTimeout()` function executes after one second, this entire loop has already gone through every iteration that it needs to and the variable `i` is being overwritten every single time.

This means that by the time the first `setTimeout()` runs, `i` is already at 10, and we don't have any way to reference its value before that.

If you have an AJAX request where you are looping through a few of them, there isn't a way without an IFFE to reference what the `i` variable was when it ran, and not what it currently is after the loop.

One quick way we can fix that is by changing `var` to `let`:

```js
for(let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
 console.log(i);
 setTimeout(function() {
   console.log('The number is ' + i);
 },1000);
}
```

What do we know about `let`? It's block-scoped. We have curly brackets in the `for` loop. If you run it now, after a second we'll log zero through nine. We're not getting 10, 10 times. We getting it as it was declared each and every time.

As a note, you can't use a `const` for this because the variable needs to overwrite itself, and you can't assign the same `const` variable twice.

When we use `let`, it is instead possible to update its value, and `let` is going to scope `i` to our curly brackets.
